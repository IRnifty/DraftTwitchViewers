FEATURES:

Draft Twitch Viewers (DTV) uses web requests to connect to Twitch, and can pick a random user from any channel, and create a Kerbal in-game with that viewer's name.

- Easy to use interface.
- Draft from any channel, specified in the GUI. Or launch a viewer drawing without adding the winner to the game!
- While getting the channel viewer list, DTV can remove bots (specified by the player/streamer) and viewers with distasteful names.
- Upon attempted draft, an alert is displayed in-game indicating success or failure.
- Customize the draft success message and the drawing success message.
- Fully compatible with both Crew Manifest and Ship Manifest.
- Players can add the viewer directly to the current vessel.
- Rescue your viewers or take them on tours with DTV modified Career Mode Contracts!
